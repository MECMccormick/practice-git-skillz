# Demo Homework Repo

This repository is a demo repository that you can use to practice your GitHub and git skills while working
through the online lessons in the [introduction to earth data science textbook on earthdatascience.org](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/git-github/version-control/). We will not merge any pull requests here but you can practice opening and closing them here if you want!

new text here!
Working from the hub, or working through Jupyter Notebook off your local machine, you can simply open the file from your Jupyter window, and edit directly.

OR you can use the Jupyter terminal to open the file using atom:

$ atom README.md - opens it in atom

save (ctrl+s) and close and look at changes
